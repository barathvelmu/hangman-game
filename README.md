# Barath's Hangman Game üÉè

## Hi there! Welcome! 
Welcome to my Hangman Game repository! If you are feeling the need to play some terminal hangman, feel free to do so! 

## What is this project? 
A terminal version of the Hangman game where anyone, who clones the repository and runs the Python script, can play! No new rules were added to the game and everything follows as the original Hangman. For those who are new to the game of Hangman, please check out: urlwee.com/rules.

## What is the goal of this project?
This project was to serve as a delicate ice-breaker for 1-on-1 coffee-chats I had/will have. I also got a little curious with game development and wanted to try experimenting. Got to really witness the power of Python!

## How do we use this game/program? 
It's just a 2 step process! Please refer below.

### 1.) Clone the repository. 
To do this, copy the url link of the project. Open up your command line (e.g. terminal, command prompt). Make sure you are in the right directory/file that you want to clone the project to (e.g. Desktop). 

Now run, 

```
git clone link-of-project
```

and hit enter. 

### 2.) Run the program
To do this simply run,

``` 
python hangman.py 
```

and that will run the program for you. 

There we go, you have just started the game. Happy Hangman-ing!

## How many awards did this project win? 
Haha I wish!
