# hangman-game

## Hi there! Welcome! 
Welcome to my Hangman Game repository! If you are feeling the need to play some terminal hangman, feel free to do so! 

## What is this project? 
This is a simple hangman game anyone can play by cloning the repository and running the Python script. There are no new rules to the game that I added and everything follows as the original hangman. For those who are new to the game of hangman, please check out: https://www.iup.edu/teachingexcellence/reflective-practice/past-events/2008-09/sample-games-to-be-used-in-the-classroom/instructions-for-playing-hangman/.

I created this project in Python and used my knowledge of data structures to build it! I wanted to have some fun and programmed this project from the ground up. 

## What is the goal of this project?
The purpose of the project is to create a fun little terminal game for friends to play with on a common computer. I am still considering converting this into a web application but as of now it simply runs just as a script. And also as I mentioned before, the core goal was to have some fun! 

## Did you use resources? 
Yes! I used a YouTube video as a followthrough to build the project. I then made changes to customize the code. This includes building new features, editing code, and revamping the entire terminal user interface!

## How do we use this program? 
It's just a 2 step process! Please refer below.

### 1.) Clone the repository. 
To do this, copy the url link of the project. Open up your command line (e.g. terminal, command prompt). Make sure you are in the right directory/file that you want to clone the project to (e.g. Desktop). 

Now run, 

```
git clone link-of-project
```

and hit enter. 

### 2.) Run the program
To do this simply run,

``` 
python hangman.py 
```

and that will run the program for you. 

There we go, you have just started the game. Happy Hangman-ing!

## What are your next steps?
If I were to do so, my next step is to try and implement this current Python script as a full-fledged web application. That would be super cool as people will get to play with their friends online. As of now, since it only runs as a local program, it is not feasible to enjoy with people online. It also doesn't carry the best user interface. 

## How many awards did this project win? 
Haha I wish!
