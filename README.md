# hangman-game

## Hi there! Welcome! 
Welcome to my Hangman Game repository! If you are feeling the need to play some terminal hangman feel free to do so! 

## What is this project? 
This is a simple hangman game anyone can play by cloning the repo and running the Python program. There are no new rules to the game that I added and everything follows as the original hangman. For those who are new to the game of hangman, please check out: https://www.iup.edu/teachingexcellence/reflective-practice/past-events/2008-09/sample-games-to-be-used-in-the-classroom/instructions-for-playing-hangman/.

I created this project in Python and used my knowledge of data structures to build it! I wanted to have some fun with Python and made this project from the ground up. 

## What is the goal of this project?
The purpose of the project is to create a fun little terminal game for friends to play with on a common computer. I am still considering moving this into a web application but as of now it is simply just a program. And also as I mentioned before, I simply wanted to have some fun programming with Python! 

## Did you use resources? 
Yes! I used a YouTube video as a followthrough to build the project. I then made custom changes to the code that I felt were better suiting the project! 

## How do we use this program? 
That is very simple! It is just a 2 step process! Please refer below.

### 1.) Clone the repository. 
To do this, copy the url link of the project. Open up your command line (e.g. terminal, command prompt). Make sure you are in the right directory/file that you want to clone the project to (e.g. Desktop). 

Now run, 

```

git clone link-of-project

```

and hit enter. 

### 2.) Run the program
To do this simply run,

``` 

python hangman.py 

```

and that will run the program for you. 

There we go, we have just started the game. Happy Hangman-ing!

## What are your next steps?
My next steps is to defientely bring my web development skills and try to bring this as a full fledegde web application. That would be super cool as people will get to play with their friends online. Right now as it only runs as a program, it is hard to enjoy with people online. It also doesn't carry the best user interface. 

## How many awards did this project win? 
Haha I wish!
